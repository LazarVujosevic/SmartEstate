## Core Features

### Phase 1 — Lifestyle Matcher
- Agents enter buyer profiles with free-text lifestyle preferences (not just square meters — lifestyle, habits, priorities)
- AI (Gemini) analyzes buyer descriptions and assigns semantic tags + structured profile
- Agents enter property listings with descriptions and images
- AI analyzes properties and assigns tags
- System matches buyers to properties based on tag/profile similarity
- Agents have a matching report page where they log buyer reactions
- AI continuously refines matching quality based on feedback history

### Phase 2 — Lead-Gen (FSBO Detection)
- Background workers continuously scrape real estate portals for new listings
- AI classifies listings as agency-posted vs. private-seller (FSBO)
- When FSBO is detected, active/subscribed agencies are immediately notified
- Notification channels: email (phase 2 launch), in-app feed
- Scraped portals: **4zida.rs, halooglasi.com, nadjidom.com, kupujemprodajem.com, nekretnine.rs**

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

**Strategy:** Row-level tenancy — every tenant-scoped entity carries a `TenantId` (Guid).

**Key rules:**
- All tenant-scoped entities implement `ITenantEntity` (exposes `TenantId`)
- EF Core **Global Query Filters** automatically scope all queries to the current tenant
- `ITenantContext` service is resolved in middleware from the JWT `tenant_id` claim
- Tenant activation is managed manually by Administrator (no self-serve billing)
- `Tenant` entity itself is NOT scoped (it is the root)

**Tenant lifecycle:**
1. Administrator creates tenant record (agency name, contact, plan)
2. Administrator creates initial `AgencyManager` user for that tenant
3. Tenant `IsActive` flag controls access — Administrator flips it manually

---

## Authentication & Authorization

**Mechanism:** ASP.NET Identity + JWT Bearer tokens (stateless)

**Roles:**
| Role | Scope | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `Administrator` | Global (cross-tenant) | Manage tenants, users, roles, system config |
| `AgencyManager` | Within own tenant | View agents' activity, reports, agency settings |
| `Agent` | Within own tenant | Manage buyers, properties, view matches/reports |

**JWT Claims:** `sub` (userId), `email`, `role`, `tenant_id`, `exp`

**Important:** Administrator has no `tenant_id` claim (or a null/special value). All other roles always have a valid `tenant_id`.

---

## Notifications

- **Phase 1:** In-app notification feed only (stored in DB, polled/loaded on page visit — no real-time push)
- **Phase 2 / Lead-Gen launch:** Email via MailKit + in-app feed
- No SignalR / WebSockets in initial phases

---

## Development Workflow (n8n Automation)

```
Owner plans sprint with Lead Dev
    ↓
Lead Dev creates GitHub Issues with labels: [backend] / [frontend]
    ↓
n8n detects new issue with [backend] label → triggers Backend Dev Claude session
n8n detects new issue with [frontend] label → triggers Frontend Dev Claude session
    ↓
Developer implements → creates Pull Request
    ↓
n8n detects new PR → triggers Lead Dev session to review
    ↓
Lead Dev reviews, approves, merges to main
    ↓
Developer checks: if no more open issues with their label → stops working
    ↓
Owner reviews milestone → plans next sprint with Lead Dev
```

**GitHub Issue Labels:**
- `backend` — Backend Dev picks up
- `frontend` — Frontend Dev picks up
- `bug` — can be combined with above
- `architecture` — Lead Dev handles directly

---

## Coding Conventions

- **Language:** C# (.NET 10), Razor (Blazor)
- **Naming:** PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for private fields, `_prefix` for private fields
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture strictly — no domain logic in controllers or infrastructure
- **CQRS:** MediatR for all commands/queries in Application layer
- **Validation:** FluentValidation in Application layer (pipeline behavior)
- **Error handling:** Result pattern (no exceptions for business logic) — use `Result<T>` or `OneOf`
- **EF Core:** Repository pattern via `IRepository<T>` in Application, implemented in Infrastructure
- **API responses:** Consistent `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper
- **No magic strings:** Use `const` or `nameof` everywhere
- **Comments:** Only when the WHY is non-obvious

---

## Environment Configuration

**Local Dev:**
- API runs on `https://localhost:7001`
- Web (Blazor WASM) runs on `https://localhost:7002`  
- Workers run independently
- PostgreSQL via Docker: `localhost:5432` (db: `smartestate`, user: `smartestate`, pass: see docker-compose)
- pgAdmin via Docker: `http://localhost:5050`
- n8n via Docker: `http://localhost:5678`

**Production:**
- Windows Server (existing hosting)
- PostgreSQL on separate machine (not Docker)
- Connection strings via environment variables / secrets

## Architectural Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-22 | .NET 10 (not .NET 9) | .NET 10 is installed on dev machine; uses .slnx format |
| 2026-04-22 | Blazor WASM (not Server) | API-first, mobile-friendly, decoupled deployment |
| 2026-04-22 | Row-level multi-tenancy | Simplest EF Core approach, sufficient isolation for SaaS |
| 2026-04-22 | JWT (not sessions/cookies) | WASM client, stateless API |
| 2026-04-22 | Gemini AI | Free tier for development phase |
| 2026-04-22 | MudBlazor | Proven component library, dark/light mode built-in |
| 2026-04-22 | No SignalR initially | Reduce complexity; email + in-app polling sufficient for MVP |
| 2026-04-22 | Separate Workers project | Scrapers must run independently of API, different scaling needs |
| 2026-04-23 | DataSeeder via `CreateAsyncScope()` (not IHostedService) | Runs once at startup, simpler than a full IHostedService for a one-off seed operation |
| 2026-04-23 | EF Core query filters reference `tenantContext` field directly | Capturing `TenantId` as a local `Guid?` in `OnModelCreating` freezes the value at model-build time; the field reference is re-evaluated per query |
| 2026-04-23 | Migrations output dir: `Persistence/Migrations` | Keeps migrations co-located with `AppDbContext` in the Infrastructure persistence folder |
| 2026-04-23 | `TenantContext` is a settable POCO (not `IHttpContextAccessor`-based) | `TenantMiddleware` sets `TenantId` explicitly — cleaner than reading from `IHttpContextAccessor` inside the context class; eliminates `HttpContext` dependency from `TenantContext` |
| 2026-04-23 | `IXxxService` pattern for Identity concerns | Application handlers cannot reference `UserManager<T>` directly; define `IAuthService` / `IUserManagementService` in Application, implement in Infrastructure — keeps Application layer free of Identity types |
| 2026-04-23 | `GlobalExceptionHandler` in `API/Common/` | Centralised exception handling via `IExceptionHandler`; catches `ValidationException` → 400, all others → 500, always returns `ApiResponse` shape |
| 2026-04-23 | `ITenantCache` in Application, `TenantCache` in Infrastructure | Cache invalidation after tenant activation needs to happen in a handler (Application layer); defining a thin `ITenantCache` interface avoids leaking `IMemoryCache` into Application |
| 2026-04-23 | `Tenant.Plan` added via `AddTenantPlan` migration | Sprint 0 schema did not include Plan; added as nullable string in Sprint 1 to avoid breaking existing rows |
| 2026-04-23 | `HealthController` and `PingController` deleted | Were test scaffolding only; no production health endpoint needed until Sprint 10 (DB-verified health check) |

## Known Constraints & Important Notes

### Architecture
- `FsboLead` entity has **no `TenantId`** — it is a global entity (scraped once, shared across all agencies). Sprint 7/8 must resolve how `GET /fsbo-leads` is scoped per tenant: either via an `InAppNotification` reference, or a `TenantFsboLead` junction table. Create an `architecture` issue when starting Sprint 7.
- EF Core Global Query Filters must reference the `ITenantContext` service field directly, not a captured `Guid?` local variable — captured locals are frozen at model-build time; field references are re-evaluated per query.
- `DataSeeder` is idempotent and runs on every API startup — it checks existence before creating. Safe to re-run.

### Backend
- `Serilog.Sinks.File` must be version `7.0.0` — `Serilog.AspNetCore 10.0.0` has a transitive dependency on `>= 7.0.0`; using 6.0.0 causes NU1605 build error
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` must be in the **startup project** (API), not only in Infrastructure — EF Core CLI tools require it on the startup project to generate migrations
- `dotnet-ef` global tool must be installed before running any migration commands: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
- Migration command: `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/SmartEstate.Infrastructure --startup-project src/SmartEstate.API`
- All database migrations must be applied manually (no auto-migration on startup in production)
- `Administrator` role is seeded on first run — credentials read from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars (or `appsettings.Development.json`); if not set, seeder skips with a warning log
- CORS policy in API is named `"BlazorWasm"` — configured for `https://localhost:7002` in dev; update `AllowedOrigins` in `appsettings.json` for prod
- Scraping portals (4zida, halooglasi, etc.) may change their HTML structure — scrapers must fail gracefully, log full context, and continue; never crash the worker
- `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt 8.17.0` must be explicitly added to Infrastructure — it is NOT transitively available via `FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App"` even though JwtBearer is in the framework
- `UseSerilogRequestLogging()` must come **before** `UseExceptionHandler()` in `Program.cs` — otherwise Serilog does not capture the rewritten status code from exception handling
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` (implements `IExceptionHandler`) is in `API/Common/` — catches `FluentValidation.ValidationException` from the MediatR pipeline and returns `400 Bad Request` with `ApiResponse` shape; catches all other exceptions and returns `500`; registered via `services.AddExceptionHandler<GlobalExceptionHandler>()` + `services.AddProblemDetails()`
- `IAuthService` pattern: when Application handlers need Identity concerns (`UserManager` etc.), define `IXxxService` in Application and implement in Infrastructure — keeps Application layer free of Identity types
- `JwtSettings` options class at `Infrastructure/Identity/JwtSettings.cs`, bound via `services.Configure<JwtSettings>(configuration.GetSection("Jwt"))` — properties: `Secret`, `Issuer`, `Audience`, `ExpiryMinutes` (default 60)
- JWT `Secret` is validated at startup (≥ 32 chars) — app throws `InvalidOperationException` if missing or too short; placeholder in `appsettings.json` is long enough for dev
- `AppClaims.TenantId` constant (`"tenant_id"`) defined in `Application/Common/Constants/AppClaims.cs` — use this everywhere instead of the string literal
- `TenantContext` is a **settable POCO** (not `IHttpContextAccessor`-based) — `TenantMiddleware` sets `TenantId` and `IsAdministrator` at request start; double-registration required: `AddScoped<TenantContext>()` + `AddScoped<ITenantContext>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<TenantContext>())`
- `TenantMiddleware` is in `Infrastructure/MultiTenancy/TenantMiddleware.cs` — registered in `Program.cs` after `UseAuthorization()` via `app.UseMiddleware<TenantMiddleware>()`
- `Tenant.Plan` is `string?` (nullable) in the domain entity — validator enforces `NotEmpty()` at API boundary; migration `AddTenantPlan` (2026-04-23)
- `AdminTenantsController` uses `[Authorize(Roles = AppRoles.Administrator)]` at controller level — all admin controllers follow this pattern; has shared `MapErrors(List<Error>)` helper that maps `NotFound/Conflict/Validation/other` to correct HTTP status + `ApiResponse`
- Controller `Problem()` fallback must NOT be used — always return `StatusCode(500, ApiResponse.Fail(...))` to maintain consistent response shape; `Problem()` returns RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails` which breaks frontend deserialization
- `IMemoryCache` registered via `services.AddMemoryCache()` in `Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs`
- `ITenantCache` interface in `Application/Common/Interfaces/` — `TenantCache` in `Infrastructure/MultiTenancy/` wraps `IMemoryCache.Remove`; used to invalidate `"tenant_active_{tenantId}"` after activation toggle
- `InactiveTenantMiddleware` in `Infrastructure/MultiTenancy/` — runs after `TenantMiddleware`; skips `/health` and `/ping` paths; caches `Tenant.IsActive` for 60s; registered via `app.UseMiddleware<InactiveTenantMiddleware>()`
- API request body records live in `API/Models/Requests/` — one file per record (e.g. `CreateTenantUserRequest.cs`, `SetTenantActiveRequest.cs`)
- `HealthController` and `PingController` were deleted — they were test scaffolding; a proper DB-verified health endpoint is planned for Sprint 10

### Frontend
- Docker Compose credentials are in `.env` (gitignored) — copy `.env.example` to `.env` before first `docker compose up -d`
- `wwwroot/appsettings.Development.json` is gitignored — only `wwwroot/appsettings.json` is tracked; configure local overrides manually after clone
- MudBlazor 9.x: `MudThemeProvider.GetSystemPreference()` no longer exists — do not use it; default to `false` (light mode) if no localStorage value
- MudBlazor 9.x: required providers in layout are `MudThemeProvider`, `MudPopoverProvider`, `MudDialogProvider`, `MudSnackbarProvider` — all four must be present or dropdowns/dialogs/snackbars will silently fail
- Theme preference is stored in `localStorage` under key `smartestate_dark_mode` (bool) — read in `OnAfterRenderAsync`, not `OnInitializedAsync` (localStorage is unavailable during prerender)
- `AuthorizeRouteView` + `RedirectToLogin` are already wired in `App.razor` — Sprint 1 Frontend only needs to register `JwtAuthStateProvider` and build the Login page
- Gemini API has rate limits on free tier — batch AI requests where possible, avoid per-request calls in loops
- Windows Server production deployment: use IIS reverse proxy for API + publish Blazor WASM as static files

### CI / GitHub
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — triggers on PR to `main`, job name is `Build & Test`
- Branch protection on `main` requires `Build & Test` status check to pass before merge
- GitHub does not allow self-approve on PRs — Lead Dev uses `gh pr merge --admin` when CI hasn't run yet on infrastructure/arch PRs
